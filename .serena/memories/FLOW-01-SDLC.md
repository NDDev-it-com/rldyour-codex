# SDLC Flow

## Scope
rldyour SDLC command lifecycle

## Current source of truth
- `path:plugins/rldyour-flow`

## Last verified
- date: 2026-06-25
- commit: `d451cc060cc197537e9be6339c0085636a886cc0`
- checked by: codex 1.6.2 PR #4 merge sync

## Facts
- Flow memories record ry-init, ry-start, ry-newp, ry-review, ry-repair, ry-deploy, and ry-sync behavior.
- `plugins/rldyour-flow/scripts/fullrepo_sync.py` includes `.rldyour/fullrepo-state.json` in the sparse fullrepo tree so overlay equality is bound to the exact base branch and base HEAD, not just agent-only file content.
- `plugins/rldyour-flow/scripts/fullrepo_sync.py` makes the CI fullrepo bootstrap race-tolerant: it retries the bootstrap (`BOOTSTRAP_CI_ATTEMPTS`, `BOOTSTRAP_CI_SLEEP_SECONDS`) and writes a `dist/gates/fullrepo-bootstrap-ci.json` receipt; the repo-local fullrepo wrapper delegation was removed. `scripts/classify_ci_noise.py` anchors the chrome-devtools update-advisory noise regex to full lines. The `release.yml` bundle step drops the `dist/gates` CI receipts before the `dist/*` checksum/upload operations so a subdirectory cannot break the release.
- `plugins/rldyour-flow/skills/ry-repair/SKILL.md` uses Antigravity CLI product wording while preserving `gemini` machine namespace compatibility where needed.

## Evidence
- `commit:d451cc060cc197537e9be6339c0085636a886cc0`
- `path:plugins/rldyour-flow`

## Known pitfalls
- Treat this memory as derived context. Current code, configuration, runtime output, and GitHub state override stale memory text.

## Update policy
Update after verified changes to the referenced source-of-truth files.

## Delete / merge policy
- Delete or merge only when the referenced source-of-truth files no longer support this memory and the replacement memory preserves the durable facts.

## Applies to
- The scope declared in this memory and the source-of-truth paths listed below.

## Source of truth
- The `Current source of truth` section above, plus current code, configuration, tests, git state, and live GitHub state where the memory explicitly references live release or repository surfaces.

## Invariants
- Code, configuration, tests, validators, git state, and live GitHub state override this memory when they disagree.

## Current State
- See `Facts` for current durable facts. Do not treat `Historical evidence`, old commit notes, or previous release entries as current state.

## Do Not Infer
- Do not infer runtime versions, product versions, commits, permissions, release state, security posture, or tool behavior from this memory without checking the source of truth.

## Update Triggers
- Update after verified changes to the source-of-truth files, runtime baselines, release tuple, validation gates, live release state, or durable agent workflow contracts.

## Validation Commands
- `python3 scripts/validate_serena_memory_schema.py --scope all --strict-mode strict-all`
- `python3 scripts/validate_serena_memory_semantics.py --scope all --strict-current-facts`
- `python3 scripts/validate_memory_freshness.py --scope all`

## Repair Procedure
- Re-read source-of-truth files, update only verified current facts, move stale facts to historical evidence, then rerun the validation commands.
