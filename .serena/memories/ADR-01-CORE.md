# ADR Core

## Scope
architecture decisions and owner-approved policy changes

## Current source of truth
- `path:docs/adr`

## Last verified
- date: 2026-05-31
- commit: `67e05455d3e35449d070874257acdfa13520f886`
- checked by: Codex ry-start memory freshness repair

## Facts
- ADR memories record decisions and policy shape. Meaning changes require explicit owner approval.
- Current Codex adapter ADRs live under `docs/adr`.

## Evidence
- `commit:67e05455d3e35449d070874257acdfa13520f886`
- `path:docs/adr`

## Known pitfalls
- Treat this memory as derived context. Current code, configuration, runtime output, and GitHub state override stale memory text.

## Update policy
ADR meaning changes require explicit owner approval; format-only normalization may be done without changing the decision.

## Delete / merge policy
- Delete or merge only when the referenced source-of-truth files no longer support this memory and the replacement memory preserves the durable facts.

## Applies to
- The scope declared in this memory and the source-of-truth paths listed below.

## Source of truth
- The `Current source of truth` section above, plus current code/config/tests/git state for the scoped repository.

## Invariants
- Code, configuration, tests, and git state override this memory when they disagree.

## Current State
- See `Facts` for current durable facts. Do not treat `Historical evidence` or old commit notes as current state.

## Do Not Infer
- Do not infer runtime versions, product versions, commits, permissions, release state, or tool behavior from this memory without checking the source of truth.

## Update Triggers
- Update after verified changes to the source-of-truth files, runtime baselines, release tuple, validation gates, or durable agent workflow contracts.

## Validation Commands
- `python3 scripts/validate_serena_memory_schema.py --scope all --strict-mode strict-all`
- `python3 scripts/validate_serena_memory_semantics.py --scope all --strict-current-facts`
- `python3 scripts/validate_memory_freshness.py --scope all`

## Repair Procedure
- Re-read source-of-truth files, update only verified current facts, move stale facts to historical evidence, then rerun the validation commands.
