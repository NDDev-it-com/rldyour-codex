## Facts
- ADR memories record decisions and policy shape. Meaning changes require explicit owner approval.

## Evidence
- `commit:86b2555935f4c2185658417a3aff82d225d25392`
- `path:docs/adr`

## Known pitfalls
- Treat this memory as derived context. Current code, configuration, runtime output, and GitHub state override stale memory text.

## Update policy
ADR meaning changes require explicit owner approval; format-only normalization may be done without changing the decision.

## Delete / merge policy
- Delete or merge only when the referenced source-of-truth files no longer support this memory and the replacement memory preserves the durable facts.
