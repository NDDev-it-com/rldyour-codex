# rldyour Flow Lifecycle

This reference defines the executable workflow behind `ry-init`, `ry-start`, `ry-newp`, `ry-review`, and `ry-deploy`.

## Global Rules

- User-facing conversation is Russian by default.
- Repository documentation, code comments, commit messages, Serena memories, plans, and research archives are English.
- Code is the source of truth. Memories and docs must be verified against code, git diff, tests, and runtime evidence.
- Serena-first inspection applies before raw file reads for supported languages.
- Research-heavy technical decisions use `rldyour-explore`.
- LSP and project checks use `rldyour-lsps`.
- UI/browser-visible changes use `rldyour-browser`.
- Security-sensitive changes use `rldyour-security` and `flow-security-review`.
- Implementation favors quality, consistency, maintainability, and scale over speed.

## ry-init

Purpose: build a reliable model of a project, module, backend/frontend/mobile area, or feature scope. The output is a scoped context pack, not a shallow file list.

Core order:

1. Git sync audit: dirty state, current branch, upstream ahead/behind, worktrees, local/remote branches.
2. If uncommitted or unmerged work exists, deeply review it. If correct and consistent, synchronize it into `main`, merge safe branches, push, and remove merged worktrees/branches. If risky, ask the user with concrete options.
3. Restore agent-only context from `fullrepo` when available and install `.git/info/exclude` rules before treating `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.serena/*`, `.claude/*`, `.codex/*`, or similar files as missing.
4. Serena readiness: `check_onboarding_performed`, onboarding if needed, `list_memories`, relevant `read_memory`.
5. Scope detection: project, module, sphere, or feature. For a sphere such as backend, inspect the whole sphere and its integration points.
6. Semantic map: `get_symbols_overview`, targeted `find_symbol`, `find_referencing_symbols`, `search_for_pattern` only when needed.
7. Data and contract map: database tables/fields, schemas, migrations, API contracts, generated artifacts, configuration keys, environment variables, and integration boundaries that affect the scope.
8. Pattern map: established project patterns for naming, layering, validation, errors, tests, state management, and dependency usage.
9. External enrichment only for unclear architecture, framework behavior, or current best practices.
10. Synthesis in Russian, with exact source-of-truth paths, symbols, contracts, checks, and known gaps.

## ry-start

Purpose: complete feature or fix lifecycle from prompt to reviewed, synchronized state.

Core order:

1. If context is missing, run a scoped `ry-init`.
2. Understand prompt and affected scope.
3. Research project code through Serena and project memories.
4. Research current best practices and libraries through `rldyour-explore`.
5. Pass the context sufficiency gate before editing: code paths, symbols, data contracts, integration points, existing patterns, checks, and research evidence must be known or explicitly marked as unknown.
6. Produce a detailed implementation plan.
7. Verify the plan against real code and adjust until coherent.
8. Create or select branch/worktree and implement through atomic commits.
9. Run progress checkpoints after meaningful milestones or every 2-3 plan groups: compare implementation against the plan, context pack, existing patterns, and touched integration path.
10. Run quality gates and fix all issues in touched scope plus integration path.
11. Run reviewer workflow. Use subagents when the `ry-start` workflow calls for parallel review.
12. Run browser/security/design/LSP workflows when triggered by the change type.
13. Synchronize Serena memories, agent-only files, AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md when present, git, GitHub, `fullrepo`, and worktree cleanup through `flow-post-task-sync`.

## Session Context

The SessionStart hook is advisory and read-only. It adds compact state at session startup or resume so Codex knows whether repository sync, Serena memory freshness, docs, dirty files, or worktrees need attention. This context informs planning; it is not a blocker.

The PostToolUse commit advice hook is advisory and read-only. It checks recently created commits for conventional commit format, suspicious sensitive paths, runtime markers, browser evidence, and broad commit scope. It informs the next model step without rejecting the command.

## Fullrepo Branch Standard

Normal project branches such as `main` should contain product source, tests, public docs, CI, and deployable configuration. Agent-only files that reveal or preserve AI workflow state should live locally and in the `fullrepo` branch, not in normal branch history.

Agent-only examples:

- root `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `REVIEW.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and `QWEN.md`;
- `.serena/project.yml`, `.serena/memories/`, `.serena/plans/`, `.serena/research/`, `.serena/newproj/`, and `.serena/deploy/`;
- `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.cursor/rules/`, `.agents/skills/`, `.agents/commands/`, `.agents/hooks/`, `.github/instructions/`, and `.github/prompts/`.

Runtime files, secrets, caches, local env files, browser artifacts, tokens, cookies, and credentials must not be published to either branch.

Use `plugins/rldyour-flow/scripts/fullrepo_sync.py` or `scripts/sync_fullrepo_branch.sh`:

- `--restore`: fetch and restore agent-only files from `origin/fullrepo` into the worktree and install `.git/info/exclude`.
- `--migrate-main`: remove currently tracked agent-only files from the current branch index through `git rm --cached`, leaving files in the worktree.
- `--publish`: build a snapshot tree from current `HEAD` plus local agent-only files and push it to `fullrepo` with `--force-with-lease`.
- `--status-json`: emit machine-readable state for hooks and diagnostics.

Use `--force-with-lease` for `fullrepo` because it protects against overwriting unexpected remote changes. Never force-push `main`.

## ry-newp

Purpose: design a new project before or alongside initial scaffold.

Output location: `.serena/newproj/<project>/`.

Default artifacts:

- `01_HLO.md`
- `02_REQUIREMENTS.md`
- `03_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `04_ADRS.md`
- `05_TECH_STACK.md`
- `06_API.md`
- `07_DATA.md`
- `08_INFRA.md`
- `09_SECURITY.md`
- `10_TESTING.md`
- `11_PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`
- `12_CONVENTIONS.md`
- `13_DELIVERY_PLAN.md`

Scaffold policy: documents first. Minimal scaffold is allowed only after the user approves it and only when it activates a useful Serena project structure without creating junk.

## ry-review

Purpose: review a diff, branch, PR, scope, or prompt with code evidence.

Review target: diff plus affected integration graph via Serena. Report-only by default.

Reviewer tracks:

- Architecture
- Implementation quality
- Consistency
- Integration synchronization
- Verification and manual tests
- Security when sensitive or explicitly requested

## ry-deploy

Purpose: synchronize local repo, GitHub, and server, then deploy and verify.

Deploy order:

1. Read deploy contract from `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or `.serena/deploy/*.md` in that priority.
2. Verify local branch, PR, quality gates, Serena memories, docs, and GitHub sync.
3. Inspect server baseline: git status, current SHA, logs before restart, disk space, process manager.
4. Pull or sync code to server.
5. Run migrations only after readiness checks and backup/rollback contract verification.
6. Restart/build services.
7. Verify logs, health, tests, and business-critical flows.
8. If deployment fails, perform RCA through logs, code, and internet research, then fix-forward. Ask the user with options for risky operations.
9. DB rollback only when an explicit rollback contract and backup/restore point are verified.
