# Post-Task Synchronization

Post-task sync is the last phase of meaningful work. It prevents forgotten changes, stale project knowledge, and mismatched local/GitHub/server state.

## Order

1. Serena memory freshness first.
2. Project instruction docs second: `AGENTS.md` and `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
3. Quality checks and manual evidence third.
4. Atomic commits fourth.
5. GitHub sync fifth.
6. Fullrepo branch sync sixth.
7. Merged branch/worktree cleanup last.

## Session And Commit Advice

The flow SessionStart hook gives Codex a compact offline repository state packet before work starts or resumes. Treat it as an input to planning: inspect tracked dirty files, local ahead/behind state, worktree count, docs, local fullrepo hints, and Serena sync-marker state before making assumptions. Deep Serena freshness, fullrepo network state, and branch cleanup are intentionally left to `ry-init`, Stop, doctor, or explicit validation.

The flow PreToolUse cwd guard blocks Bash commands that would rename or remove the active Codex session directory or repository root. The flow PostToolUse hook emits commit advice after Bash `git commit` commands. Advice is informational and should be reviewed before pushing or final delivery, but it must not be treated as a hard failure by itself.

## Serena Interaction

`rldyour-serena-mcp` owns `.serena/memories`, `.serena/plans`, and `.serena/research`. The flow hook must not duplicate that work. It waits until the Serena state script reports current knowledge, then asks for `flow-post-task-sync`.

In fullrepo-managed projects, Serena knowledge is not committed to normal branches. The Serena commit helper may acknowledge current knowledge and clear runtime sync markers without committing when `.serena` knowledge paths are untracked/ignored. Flow then publishes the complete snapshot to `fullrepo`.

## AGENTS.md And .claude/CLAUDE.md

Codex reads `AGENTS.md` as project instructions. Update it when the task changes durable project rules, setup commands, quality gates, deploy contracts, architecture constraints, or agent workflow guidance. Keep it Codex-native and practical: repository layout, commands, checks, constraints, tool routing, and done criteria.

Claude Code reads project memory from `.claude/CLAUDE.md` in rldyour fullrepo-managed projects. Create and update it for every such project, optimized for Claude Code rather than as a thin copy of `AGENTS.md`: commands, architecture, workflow, conventions, Claude Code diagnostics, and Claude-specific settings/hooks/skills locations.

Both files must contain verified facts, not chat history or speculative plans.

For default rldyour-managed projects, root `AGENTS.md`, `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, and `REVIEW.md` are agent-only files restored from `fullrepo`, ignored through `.git/info/exclude`, and excluded from normal branch history. Project policy may explicitly allow tracked instruction/AI files in normal branches; scripts read `.rldyour/project-policy.json`, `.rldyour/project-policy.local.json`, or `RLDYOUR_PROJECT_POLICY`.

Use `plugins/rldyour-flow/scripts/instruction_docs_state.py --json` to decide whether review is needed and `python3 scripts/validate_instruction_docs.py --require-agent-docs` when agent-only context is restored.

## Fullrepo Branch

`fullrepo` is the portable complete-state branch. It lets a new machine initialize with the same agent-only project context while keeping `main` and feature branches free of AI workflow files.

Post-task flow:

1. Commit and push normal source/test/docs/config changes to the current upstream branch.
2. Ensure `.git/info/exclude` has the rldyour fullrepo block.
3. If policy keeps agent files out of the normal branch and the project is ready, run `fullrepo_sync.py --migrate-main` once and commit that index cleanup.
4. Run `fullrepo_sync.py --publish` after the normal branch is at its final `HEAD` only when policy requires or allows fullrepo.
5. Verify `fullrepo_sync.py --status-json` and branch refs before final delivery.

Resolve helper scripts before running them. Prefer repo-local `plugins/rldyour-flow/scripts/*` in this repository or any repo that vendors the plugin; otherwise use `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/plugins/cache/rldyour-codex/rldyour-flow/local/scripts/*`. Stop-hook continuation messages include absolute installed paths for product repositories.

Initialization flow:

1. Resolve project policy with `project_flow_policy.py --json`, then run `fullrepo_sync.py --bootstrap-init` only when fullrepo restore/bootstrap is allowed.
2. If `origin/fullrepo` exists, restore its agent-only files and install excludes.
3. If `origin/fullrepo` does not exist, do not create it unless `fullrepo.create_if_missing=true`, `--create-missing`, or the current user instruction explicitly allows creation.
4. If the current branch tracks agent-only files, remove them from the index only when policy says they should be fullrepo-managed.

`fullrepo` uses safe force updates because it is a generated snapshot branch. Use `--force-with-lease`, not a blind `--force`, so an unexpected remote update cannot be silently overwritten.

## Loop Prevention

The Stop hook writes `.serena/.flow_sync_marker` with a fingerprint of HEAD, dirty files, ahead/behind, branch, policy, and blocking/advisory reasons. If the same fingerprint already requested a continuation during active Stop processing, the hook writes `.serena/.flow_blocker_ack.json` and allows stop to avoid a loop. Stop-state checks use local-only fullrepo status; network fetch/push/publish checks belong to explicit sync and validation commands.

Bootstrap-only `.serena` files created by tool startup, such as an untracked `.serena/project.yml` plus runtime markers, are not meaningful work by themselves and must not trigger a post-task sync continuation.

Runtime markers are ignored by git:

- `.serena/.flow_sync_marker`
- `.serena/.flow_post_task_state.json`
- `.serena/.flow_blocker_ack.json`

## Commit Rules

- Commit source changes by logical feature/fix/refactor units.
- Commit Serena/docs sync separately when it improves history clarity.
- Never commit secrets, runtime markers, browser artifacts, local env files, or accidental generated junk.
- Use Conventional Commits.
- Push to upstream when configured. If upstream is missing, ask before setting it.

## Cleanup Rules

- Remove merged worktrees and branches only after verifying they are merged into `main` and pushed if needed.
- `flow_post_task_state.py` exposes `branch_cleanup_state.blocking_candidates` and `advisory_candidates`; only policy-allowed blocking candidates keep `needs_flow_sync` true.
- Delete remote branches after merge only when policy allows it, the branch was created for this workflow, and no open PR depends on it. Protected branches such as `main`, `dev`, and `fullrepo` are never cleanup candidates.
- Ask the user if branch ownership, merge status, or remote state is unclear.
