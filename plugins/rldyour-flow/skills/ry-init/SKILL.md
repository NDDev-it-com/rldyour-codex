# ry-init

## Purpose

Build a verified mental model of the requested project scope before implementation. If the scope is a sphere such as backend or mobile UI, inspect the entire sphere and all integration points needed to understand how it works end to end.

`ry-init` is read-only for project knowledge by default. Agent context is tracked normally on the main branch, so it reads directly from the checked-out tree; it must not create, edit, or delete Serena memories unless the user explicitly asks to update/synchronize memories or an active stale-memory hook requires synchronization.

## Workflow

1. Run `plugins/rldyour-flow/scripts/git_sync_audit.sh` when available.
2. Inspect dirty work, old branches, and worktrees. If code is correct and consistent, synchronize it into `main`, push, and remove merged branches/worktrees. If risky, explain the issue in Russian and ask the user with concrete options.
3. Resolve effective project policy with `plugins/rldyour-flow/scripts/project_flow_policy.py --json` when available. Agent context is tracked normally on the main branch, so no restore/bootstrap step is needed; read it directly from the checked-out tree.
4. Read `references/init-context-pack.md` and use it as the required context-pack contract.
5. Use `serena-code-workflow`: check onboarding, list memories, read relevant memories, and use Serena semantic tools before raw reads.
6. Map the requested scope deeply enough to understand modules, layers, symbols, DB fields, schemas, APIs, generated artifacts, configs, tests, and integration paths.
7. Use `lsp-routing` or `lsp-health-check` when language server support affects understanding.
8. Use `tech-research` or `web-research` only for unclear technology, architecture, or current best-practice questions.
9. Synthesize a Russian report with exact source-of-truth paths, current behavior, data/contracts, integration points, quality gates, risks, gaps, and what Codex can now safely change.
10. Do not run `serena-memory-sync` automatically. If initialization discovers useful durable facts that are missing from memories, report them under `Memory candidates (not written)` with exact source paths and ask before writing. Only run `serena-memory-sync` during `ry-init` when the user explicitly requested memory sync/update or a Stop/stale-memory hook requires it.

## Role Declaration (Orchestrator)

Session role is declarative, not auto-detected:

- If the user's init request explicitly declares this terminal the orchestrator
  (for example "я оркестратор", "this terminal is the orchestrator"), verify the
  preconditions: macOS, a cmux session (`CMUX_WORKSPACE_ID`/`CMUX_SURFACE_ID`
  present), and the `rldyour-orchestrator` plugin installed. When they hold,
  adopt the orchestrator duties from `$cmux-orchestrator` for the rest of the
  session: own user communication, task decomposition, delegation, final
  validation, and sync. When a precondition fails, say which one and continue
  in standard mode.
- Without that explicit declaration, always run in standard mode - never
  auto-activate orchestrator behavior from environment, policy, or guesswork.
- Worker terminals are not declared by the user: they are machine-identified by
  the launcher/layout environment (`RLDYOUR_AGENT_ROLE=worker`,
  `RLDYOUR_WORKER_ID`) and follow `$cmux-worker`.

## Scope Rules

- Empty scope means whole project.
- Sphere scope means the whole sphere plus integration points.
- Feature scope means trace all layers touched by that feature.
- Ambiguous scope means ask the user with 2-3 options.
- Do not stop at file lists. The initialized context must explain how relevant code works end to end.
- For database-backed or API work, include fields, schemas, migrations, payloads, and caller/client paths.
- For UI/client work, include routes/screens/components, state, API calls, design-system constraints, browser-visible behavior, and tests.
- Agent context files such as `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.serena/*`, `.claude/*`, `.codex/*`, `.cursor/rules/*`, or `.agents/skills/*` are tracked normally on the main branch; read them directly from the checked-out tree as normal source files.
- Runtime snapshots, server log summaries, health-check timestamps, current container status, and one-off audit observations are report material, not Serena memory material, unless they reveal a stable code/config contract.

## Output

Report in Russian:

- Scope initialized.
- Git/GitHub/worktree state.
- Architecture and data flow.
- Key files and symbols.
- Data models, DB fields, schemas, API contracts, config/env keys, and generated artifacts.
- Integration points.
- Tests, LSP/check commands, browser/security/design evidence when relevant.
- Known risks and gaps.
- Memory candidates (not written), only when useful durable facts were found and memory sync was not explicitly requested.
- Ready-for tasks.
